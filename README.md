# Hi, I'm VarshithPawarHR 👋



## About Me 🚀

Myself Varshith Pawar H R, a student by day 📚 and a nocturnal coder by night 🌙. My life revolves around trying to understand code, fix bugs, and maintain a semblance of sanity while typing away like a caffeinated monkey 🕵️‍♂️.

In my free time, I'm always on the hunt for bugs, both in real life 🐜 and in my code. I believe that every bug is a learning opportunity, and I'm committed to improving my skills day by day.

## Balancing Act 🎮

Gaming breaks? They're just "research" for better UI/UX, right? 🎮 At least that's what I tell myself when I'm diving into the gaming world. It's all about improving user experiences, after all! 😉


## Interests 🌟

I have a wide range of interests, including:

- Anime 🍿
- Coding 💻
- Design 🎨
- Dogs 🐶

## Current Learning Journey 🌱

Right now, I'm focused on expanding my coding skills, particularly in:

- JavaScript (JS) 🌐
- Java ☕
